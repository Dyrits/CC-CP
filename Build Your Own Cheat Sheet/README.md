### Description of the project by [code]cademy
> HTML | CSS | Web Development

#### Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

#### Details | Comments
This version is made mostly with tables, using basic CSS. The grid system is also used for the navbar but not in a very efficient way. Nevertheless, the project will probably not be reworked but a similar project, yet quite different, has been made after this one (as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp).
